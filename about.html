        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p> At TerraSpeak, we believe that language should never be a barrier to connection, 
            collaboration, or success. Our journey began when our founder, Emma Laurent, a
            seasoned interpreter and lifelong language enthusiast, found herself in a 
            high-stakes business meeting between two companies—one French, one Japanese—where 
            simple mistranslation nearly cost them a multimillion-dollar deal. In that moment, 
            she realized the true power of precise, culturally aware translation.
            
            Determined to bridge these communication gaps, Emma teamed up with Carlos Mendes, 
            a polyglot tech expert, and Aisha Patel, a linguist specializing in legal and 
            financial translation. Together, they built TerraSpeak—a company dedicated to 
            helping businesses and individuals communicate seamlessly across languages and cultures.</p>
            
        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Language is more than just words—it's meaning, nuance, and intent. Whether you're 
            sealing an international business deal, expanding into new markets, or hosting a 
            global conference, our team ensures that your message is not just translated, but 
            truly understood.
            
            We know firsthand the challenges of miscommunication. Carlos once watched a software 
            launch fail in Brazil because the localization team missed key cultural nuances. Aisha 
            helped a client avoid a legal disaster by catching an overlooked contract clause during 
            translation. These experiences fuel our passion for accuracy, clarity, and the human 
            touch in every project.</p>
